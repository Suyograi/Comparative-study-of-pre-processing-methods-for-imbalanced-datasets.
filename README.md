Overview
This thesis provides overview of the approaches to the classification problem in the presence 
of class imbalanced data. It investigates several pre-processing techniques for unbalanced 
datasets. Also, a variety of models are assessed with the goal of identifying those that more 
effectively handle the categorization issue presented by imbalanced datasets. Additionally, 
the use case would include study the extensions of pre-processing techniques as border line 
SMOTE, SMOTEENN, adaptive synthetic sampling, etc. 

The main contribution of the thesis is to identify the ideal pre- processing method while dealing 
with class imbalance to apply a machine learning algorithm taking into consideration a certain 
evaluation metric. 
In this context, main research questions are formulated:  
1. Which existing techniques improve classification in the presence of class imbalanced data? 
2. What is the impact of applying pre-processing method and machine learning algorithm on 
uncleaned data as compared to clean data?
