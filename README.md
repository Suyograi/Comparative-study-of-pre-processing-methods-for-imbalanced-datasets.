Overview
This thesis provides overview of the approaches to the classification problem in the presence 
of class imbalanced data. It investigates several pre-processing techniques for unbalanced 
datasets. Also, a variety of models are assessed with the goal of identifying those that more 
effectively handle the categorization issue presented by imbalanced datasets. Additionally, 
the use case would include study the extensions of pre-processing techniques as border line 
SMOTE, SMOTEENN, adaptive synthetic sampling, etc. 

The main contribution of the thesis is to identify the ideal pre- processing method while dealing 
with class imbalance to apply a machine learning algorithm taking into consideration a certain 
evaluation metric. 
In this context, main research questions are formulated:  
1. Which existing techniques improve classification in the presence of class imbalanced data? 
2. What is the impact of applying pre-processing method and machine learning algorithm on 
uncleaned data as compared to clean data?

Conclusion
Given the overview provided in chapter 1 and 2 and the experiments we showed in chapter 3, 
the research questions could be answered as below: 
From the research, two questions have been answered to best resolve class imbalance 
problem. 
1. Which existing techniques improve classification in the presence of class imbalanced data? 
It is clear that a combination and of undersampling and oversampling techniques 
(SMOTEENN , SMOTETOMEK) could lead to the best model performance instead of applying 
these techniques. 
2. What is the impact of applying pre-processing method and machine learning algorithm on 
uncleaned data? 
Performing data cleaning before balancing the data improves model performance and overall 
accuracy. 
Therefore, to conclude, to best resolve class imbalance problem it is ideal to clean the data 
before applying a combination of undersampling and oversampling techniques(SMOTEENN, 
SMOTETOMEK)
